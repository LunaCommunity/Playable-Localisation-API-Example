# Playable-Localisation-API-Example

This example showcases how to localise your playable's text using our new API, alongside Scriptable Objects!

To try it out simply:
1. Clone the repo & Open it in Unity 
2. Add the Luna Playable Plugin to your project
3. Select the scene in the plugin & building & upload to playground

From here try opening the playground build on your phone, then set your phone's language to English, French or Italian and see the text update accordingly!

(Note: You are **not** limited to these 3 language options, these are just the ones prepared for in this example)
